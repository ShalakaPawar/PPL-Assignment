Solutions:

	1]  One declaration per line. The global declaration ‘int Z’ has disappeared and is not 
	    explicitly declared, but presumably it has a unique name meaning consistency in any 
	    access to it is preserved. For using Z, its value is loaded to/stored from locals.
	    There is no declaration for global variables, they are used directly.
	2]  One operation per line. Temporaries are introduced whenever an operation is used as 
	    an intermediate component of a computation.
	3]  Floats and doubles are represented using scientific notation. An explicit cast is 
	    inserted when a float is assigned to an int.
	4]  Reads/writes to Z are performed through loads to/stores from locals. A temporary is 
	    required for  Z=Z+1 because the result of the computation Z+1 cannot be written 
	    directly to a memory location.
